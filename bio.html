      <p>My name is Hervy Garren Byrd and I am an aspiring full-stack developer looking for work in the Bay Area. Currently I am enrolled in the coding bootcamp at UC Berkeley Extension in order to achieve my goals. I am an optmistic student and look forward to putting my newly aacquired skills to use. When I'm not learnig new software development skills I like to spend my time helping college students manage their money. Money managment has always been something that I've been good at and I have a small business helping students develop the necessary tools to manage their own money. It is a very rewarding way for me to spend my time. All-in-all i know I have a bright future ahead of me and I am anxious to see where this road will eventually lead!  <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">www.lipsum.com</a></p>
